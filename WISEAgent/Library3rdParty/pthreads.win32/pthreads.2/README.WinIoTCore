PTHREADS-WINIOTCORE
==============
 
 1. Invoke VS x86 Native Tools Command Prompt

 2. Set environment variables
	
	* You can either run IoT-Vars.cmd to setup environment variables,
     or do the step a and b as follows.
   
   (a) setup INCLUDE as VC++\Windows\Windows IoT Core

     > set INCLUDE=%VCINSTALLDIR%include;%VCINSTALLDIR%atlmfc\include;%WindowsSdkDir%Include\10.0.10240.0\ucrt;%WindowsSdkDir%Include\10.0.10240.0\um;%WindowsSdkDir%Include\10.0.10240.0\shared;%WindowsSdkDir%Include\10.0.10240.0\winrt;%NETFXSDKDir%Include\um
   
	   * Note: the above path can be found in the property of project of 
	   "Blank Windows IoT Core Console Application", and the target platform version 
	   of the project is 10.0.10240.0. You can find the paths by doing following things:
	   (i)  Open the Property page of the project: VC++ directories -> Include directories -> Edit
	   (ii) You shall found them in the Evaluated value box. If the target platform version is 
	        changed, the path should be changed as well.

    (b) setup LIB as VC++\Windows\Windows IoT Core
	
     > set LIB=%VCINSTALLDIR%lib\onecore;%WindowsSdkDir%lib\10.0.10240.0\um\x86;%NETFXSDKDir%lib\um\x86;%WindowsSdkDir%lib\10.0.10240.0\ucrt\x86
   
	   * Note: the above path can be found in the property of project of 
	   "Blank Windows IoT Core Console Application", and the target platform version 
	   of the project is 10.0.10240.0. You can find the paths by doing following things:
	   (i)  Open the Property page of the project: VC++ directories -> Library directories -> Edit
	   (ii) You shall found them in the Evaluated value box. If the target platform version is 
	        changed, the path should be changed as well.

 3. Navigate to the directory of pthreads.win32\pthreads.2

 4. Modify the config file pthreads.win32\pthreads.2\config.h
 
	ยง  Line 58
		# define HAVE_STRUCT_TIMESPEC:
	ยง  Line 61
		# define NEED_PROCESS_AFFINITY_MASK

 5. Build binary by
	> nmake clean VCE
	
 6. Binary files will be placed under pthreads.win32\pthreads.2
